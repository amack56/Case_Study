lstm, autocorrelation, data windowing

do three things

look at autocorrelation

plug data into at least 3 different models:
OLS, LSTM, another one

figure out how we're going to do the paris strategy

could plug in dummy data, paper trading portfolio

essemble modeling

tree-based model, deep learning model, ensemble model (could do some clustering), could maybe build pipelines but might not have enough time

hyper parameter tunning

visualization, hvplot, dashboards
